## 3. How to Run and Test the Project

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended)
- Java 17+ and Maven (for running the backend locally)
- Node.js and npm (for running the frontend locally)
- A running PostgreSQL instance (if not using Docker)
- Stripe account with API keys.

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1.  **Configuration:**
    - Fill in the placeholder values in the `docker-compose.yml` file for the database password and Stripe API keys.
2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    - The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
    - The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Running Locally

1.  **Backend:**
    - Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database running and update the `application.properties` file with your database credentials and Stripe API keys.
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
      ```bash
      ./mvnw spring-boot:run
      ```
2.  **Frontend:**
    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
      ```bash
      npm install
      npm start
      ```

### Publishing the Repository

To publish the repository to a remote, you will need to provide the remote URL. Once you have the URL, you can run the following commands:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-remote-url>
git push -u origin dev
```
